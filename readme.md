# IronHack Payments Cohort Analysis - Ironhack DSML Bootcamp - Project I

## Project Overview
IronHack Payments, a forward-thinking financial services company, offers cash advance solutions. As part of their continuous improvement efforts, IronHack Payments commissioned a cohort analysis project. The goal is to analyze user cohorts based on the month of their first cash advance and track key metrics such as service usage frequency, incident rate, and revenue over time.

### Key Objectives:
- **Frequency of Service Usage**: Analyze how often each cohort uses the cash advance services.
- **Incident Rate**: Measure payment incidents and track their variation across cohorts.
- **Revenue Generation**: Calculate the total revenue generated by each cohort over time.
- **New Metrics**: Propose new metrics to gain further insights into user behavior.
